<p class=name> Here is the story of her nickname: </p>
<p class=name> Well... Cookie Dough is quite the long name, isn't it, so as it
usually goes with long names hers eventually got shortened. To cookie. Now she
is dearly known as Cookie and her longer full name is somewhat obsolete <p/>

<p class=origin> Here is the story of how Cookie became a part of my family: </p>
<p class=origin> I loved my first cat <a href="matilda.html"> matilda </a>
so much that I wanted another cat. So... on my tenth birthday I got Cookie!
Although she was for the whole family I had the opportunity to name her. After much
much thought I came upon the name... Cookie Dough. I loved cookies, so I thought
what better to name my cat. </p>
