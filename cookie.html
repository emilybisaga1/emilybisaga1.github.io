<div id=story>
<p class=story> roughly 9 years old </p>
<p class=story> I loved my first cat <a href="matilda.html"> matilda </a>
so much that I wanted another cat. So... on my tenth birthday I got Cookie!   
Although she was for the whole family I had the opportunity to name her. After much
much thought I came upon the name... Cookie Dough. I loved cookies, so I thought 
what better to name my cat. </p>
<p class=story> Well... Cookie Dough is quite the long name, isn't it, so as it  
usually goes with long names hers eventually got shortened. To cookie. Now she    
is dearly known as Cookie and her longer full name is somewhat obsolete <p/>
<p class=story> Cookie is one of the most loving members of the family. She will
come up to you whenever you are sitting or laying and lie right down on your lap.
She adores attention and sometimes cries when you don't give her enough of it.</p>
