is dearly known as Cookie and her longer full name is somewhat obsolete <p/>

<p class=origin> Here is the story of how Cookie became a part of my family: </p>
<p>
<p class=origin> I loved my first cat <a href="matilda.html"> matilda </a>
so much that I wanted another cat. So... on my tenth birthday I got Cookie!
Although she was for the whole family I had the opportunity to name her. After much
much thought I came upon the name... Cookie Dough. I loved cookies, so I thought
what better to name my cat. </p>

come up to you whenever you are sitting or laying and lie right down on your lap.
